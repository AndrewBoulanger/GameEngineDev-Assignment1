A single player pong-\/like game made with Ogre3D

controls with W and S or the up and down arrow keys

press esc to quit the game.

design decisions\+:

I decided to pass the scene manager reference into the ball and paddle objects to avoid cluttering up the game setup. This way the game just needs to call the constructor.

The ball has it\textquotesingle{}s own collision reaction function which is called immediately after the game class checks for collisions, rather than having the check collision function tell the ball what to do. I could say I\textquotesingle{}m trying to be more object oriented, but actually I\textquotesingle{}m just being lazy and not checking for penetration, so this method makes sure that collision responses aren\textquotesingle{}t being called while the ball is moving out of the paddle.

I decided to add some randomness to the ball\textquotesingle{}s response too, when the ball bounces off of the paddle it changes the ball\textquotesingle{}s y velocity up or down by a random amount. The random amount will, at most, be 25\% of the max speed. I take a random number, mod(\%) it to half the max speed and reduce that by half of the half speed (so +/-\/ 25\%). I made it 25\% because it felt jarring if it was too much of a change, but I still wanted some variety.

AABB-\/ circle collision still has some odd behaviour when it hits on the corners. It sometimes reflects in directions that don\textquotesingle{}t quite look right.
